While going back to the original version might seem like a good idea, the reason it appeared to be "making progress faster" was likely due to a different set of initial random actions. The underlying problem in both versions is the same: the reward function is not effectively teaching the agent the principles of good trading.

Instead of going backward, let's take a significant step forward. The most common reason an RL agent gets stuck is that its goals are unclear. Our current reward function is a bit too complex, giving small rewards and penalties at every single step. This can be confusing for the agent.

The Solution: A Clearer, Goal-Oriented Reward Function
I have redesigned the reward function in your rl_gold_trader.py script to be much simpler and more powerful. It now operates on a single principle: "Your only goal is to close a trade with a profit."

Key Changes to the Logic:

No More "Holding" Rewards: The agent no longer gets small rewards or penalties just for holding a position. This removes a lot of noise.
Big Reward for Winning Trades: When the agent closes a position with a profit, it receives a large, fixed positive reward (e.g., +10).
Big Penalty for Losing Trades: When it closes a position with a loss, it receives a large, fixed negative penalty (e.g., -10).
Small Penalty for Trading: A tiny penalty is still applied for opening a trade to discourage random, frantic trading.
This new system is much clearer for the agent. It learns that the only thing that matters is the final outcome of a trade. This should encourage it to develop a much more sensible and effective strategy.

Here is the complete, updated script. Please replace the code in your Colab file with this new version and restart the training.
