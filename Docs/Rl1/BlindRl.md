Of course. This is an excellent set of questions. Your intuition that the model might be "blind" is correct in a crucial way.

Here is a full presentation on how your system works, the data it uses, and a detailed set of recommendations for improving it, based on the code and data you've provided.

### **Presentation: How Your Reinforcement Learning Trading Bot Works**

This presentation breaks down your project into its two key phases: how the "brain" is trained and how the "robot" uses that brain to trade.

-----

### **Part 1: The Training Phase (Creating the 'Brain')**

This phase happens entirely within your `rl_gold_traderv0_01.py` script. The goal is to create a model file (`rl_gold_trader.pth`) that contains a learned trading strategy.

**1. What data does it learn from?**
The model is trained using the historical data in your `gold_data_with_sentiment_hourly.csv` file. This file is the model's entire universe during training. It contains:

  * **Price Data**: Standard Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) prices for gold on an hourly basis.
  * **News Sentiment Data**: Two columns, `sentiment_score` and `sentiment_magnitude`, which represent the positive/negative feeling and the strength of news articles at that time.

**2. How does it learn?**
It plays a "game" using this historical data. In each step (each hour), it looks at the current situation (the "State") and decides on an action. It's then given a "Reward" based on the outcome.

  * **The State (What the model "sees"):** At each hour, the model is shown a snapshot of the market based on the last 100 hours. This snapshot includes:

      * Price changes.
      * Technical indicators calculated from the price: **RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands**.
      * The **historical news sentiment score** from your CSV file.
      * Whether it currently holds a position.

  * **The Actions (What the model can "do"):**

      * **Buy**: Open a long position.
      * **Sell**: Close the current position.
      * **Hold**: Do nothing.

  * **The Reward (How it knows if it did well):**

      * The model is rewarded based on the **Profit and Loss (P\&L)** of its trades.
      * It receives a small penalty for holding a position to encourage active, profitable trading.

The model runs through this game thousands of times, adjusting its internal neural network to maximize its total reward. The final, optimized strategy is then saved to `rl_gold_trader.pth`.

### **Part 2: The Live Trading Phase (The 'Robot' in Action)**

This phase is handled by your `live_rl_trading.py` application, which loads the pre-trained `rl_gold_trader.pth` file to make decisions.

**1. Does it get real-time information before making a decision?**
**Yes, but only price information.** Every hour, the `TradingWorker` performs the following steps:

1.  **Fetch Live Price Data**: It connects to the Capital.com API and downloads the most recent \~150 hourly price candles for gold.
2.  **Construct the State**: It uses this fresh price data to calculate the exact same technical indicators it was trained on (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).

**2. Does it get real-time information from a news API?**
**No, it does not.** This is the most critical disconnect in your system.

Your live code **does not** connect to any news service. When constructing the state vector to feed to the model, it sets the `sentiment_score` to a hardcoded dummy value of `0.0`.

```python
# From live_rl_trading.py in the construct_state function
def construct_state(self, df, current_position):
    # ... calculates indicators ...
    
    # --- This is the critical line ---
    sentiment_score = 0.0 # Using a neutral placeholder
    
    # ... builds the state_parts list ...
    state = np.array(state_parts)
    return self.scaler.transform([state])[0]
```

### **Answering Your Key Question: "Is My Model Blind?"**

**Yes, in a way, your live model is partially blind.**

It was trained in a world where it could see both **price action and news sentiment**. It learned a strategy that relies on the combination of these two data types.

In the live environment, you are only showing it the **price action**. You have taken away its ability to see the news sentiment, which it expects as an input. This mismatch between training and live conditions is the most likely reason for poor performance and is the \#1 area you need to address.

-----

### **Recommendations for Improvement**

Here are the steps you should consider to make your model smarter and more effective, in order of importance.

#### **1. High Priority: Integrate Live News Sentiment**

Your model is expecting sentiment data. You must provide it.

  * **Action**: Sign up for a real-time news API that provides sentiment analysis. Popular choices include:
      * NewsAPI.io
      * Alpha Vantage (has a news sentiment endpoint)
      * Contify
  * **Code Change**: Modify the `construct_state` function in `live_rl_trading.py`. Instead of `sentiment_score = 0.0`, you will make an API call to your chosen news service to get the latest sentiment for "gold" and use that real value.

#### **2. Medium Priority: Enhance the "State" (Give the Model Better Vision)**

The more relevant information the model sees, the better its decisions can be.

  * **More Candles**: You are correct. Increasing the `LOOKBACK_WINDOW` from 100 in your training script could help the model identify longer-term trends. You must ensure the live bot uses the same window size.
  * **More Technical Indicators**: Add more indicators to your state in both the training and live scripts. Good candidates for gold trading include:
      * **Average True Range (ATR)**: To understand market volatility.
      * **Stochastic Oscillator**: To identify overbought/oversold conditions.
  * **Correlated Asset Data**: Gold prices are heavily influenced by other markets. Consider adding data from:
      * **The US Dollar Index (DXY)**: Gold and the dollar often move in opposite directions.
      * **The VIX (Volatility Index)**: High market fear can drive investors to gold as a safe haven.

#### **3. Lower Priority: Refine the Model and Training Process**

These are more advanced steps for once you have the data inputs fixed.

  * **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with the settings in `rl_gold_traderv0_01.py`, such as the `learning_rate`, the number of neurons in the neural network, and the `gamma` (discount factor).
  * **Reward Function**: Your current reward is P\&L. You could implement a more advanced function like the **Sharpe Ratio**, which rewards the model for generating returns with less risk (volatility).
  * **More Historical Data**: The more high-quality data you can train on (e.g., more years of hourly data with consistent sentiment scores), the more robust your model will become.

By focusing on providing your live bot with the same quality and type of data it was trained on, you will take the most significant step toward improving its performance.
