Excellent. I have reviewed your latest live_rl_trading.py file, and all the previous changes for integrating live news sentiment are correctly implemented. Your bot is ready for the next level of enhancement.

You are asking for the "Medium Priority" updates, which is the perfect next step. The goal is to give your model a much richer understanding of the market by adding more data points (technical indicators and correlated assets).

CRITICAL REMINDER: The following changes will alter the structure of the data your model sees (the "State"). Therefore, after implementing these changes in your live_rl_trading.py script, you MUST make parallel changes to your data_pipeline.py and rl_gold_traderv0_01.py scripts and then RETRAIN YOUR MODEL. The existing model file will not work with this new, expanded state.

Action Plan: Enhancing the Model's Vision
Here is the step-by-step guide to update your live_rl_trading.py script.

Prerequisites
Ensure the pandas-ta library is installed, as it's used for the new indicators:

Bash

pip install pandas-ta
Step 1: Update Global Constants
Add the EPICs for the correlated assets (DXY and VIX) to your constants section at the top of the file. Note: These EPICs can vary; you may need to search for the correct ones for your broker in the Capital.com app.

Python

# In live_rl_trading.py

# --- Constants ---
# ... (existing constants) ...
DXY_EPIC = "IX.D.DXY.IFD.IP"  # Example EPIC for US Dollar Index
VIX_EPIC = "IX.D.VOLX.IFD.IP"  # Example EPIC for Volatility Index (VIX)
Step 2: Modify run_trading_cycle to Fetch Correlated Data
We need to update the trading cycle to fetch not only gold data but also the latest data for DXY and VIX.

Python

# In the TradingWorker class

def run_trading_cycle(self):
    """
    Executes a single, complete trading cycle: fetches data, constructs state,
    gets model action, and executes trade.
    """
    if not self.is_scaler_fitted:
        self.log_message.emit("Scaler not fitted. Halting cycle.", "error")
        return

    # --- Fetch all required market data at once ---
    self.log_message.emit("Fetching all market data (GOLD, DXY, VIX)...", "info")
    try:
        # Fetch Gold data
        gold_market_data = self.api.get_historical_prices(TRADING_EPIC, RESOLUTION, max_points=LOOKBACK_WINDOW + 50)
        if not gold_market_data or 'prices' not in gold_market_data:
            self.log_message.emit("Failed to get GOLD market data from API.", "error")
            return
        df_gold = self.create_ohlc_df(gold_market_data['prices'])

        # Fetch DXY data
        dxy_market_data = self.api.get_historical_prices(DXY_EPIC, RESOLUTION, max_points=LOOKBACK_WINDOW + 50)
        df_dxy = self.create_ohlc_df(dxy_market_data['prices']) if dxy_market_data and 'prices' in dxy_market_data else None

        # Fetch VIX data
        vix_market_data = self.api.get_historical_prices(VIX_EPIC, RESOLUTION, max_points=LOOKBACK_WINDOW + 50)
        df_vix = self.create_ohlc_df(vix_market_data['prices']) if vix_market_data and 'prices' in vix_market_data else None

    except Exception as e:
        self.log_message.emit(f"Error fetching market data: {e}", "error")
        return
    # --- End of data fetching ---

    # Get current position info
    open_positions = self.api.get_open_positions()
    if open_positions is None:
        self.log_message.emit("Failed to get open positions from API.", "error")
        return
    position_for_epic = next((p for p in open_positions if p.get('market',{}).get('epic') == TRADING_EPIC), None)

    # ... (News fetching logic remains exactly the same) ...
    self.log_message.emit("üì∞ Fetching live news sentiment...", "info")
    try:
        articles = self.news_api.get_news(query="gold", language="en")
        live_sentiment_score = 0.0
        if articles:
            sentiments = [get_sentiment(article['title']) for article in articles if article.get('title')]
            if sentiments:
                live_sentiment_score = sum(sentiments) / len(sentiments)
                self.log_message.emit(f"Sentiment score found: {live_sentiment_score:.2f}", "info")
        else:
            self.log_message.emit("No recent news found for sentiment.", "info")
    except Exception as e:
        self.log_message.emit(f"Error fetching news: {e}", "error")
        live_sentiment_score = 0.0
    
    # Pass all dataframes and sentiment to construct the new state
    state_vector = self.construct_state(df_gold, df_dxy, df_vix, position_for_epic, live_sentiment_score)
    if state_vector is None:
        self.log_message.emit("Could not construct state vector from data.", "error")
        return
        
    # ... (The rest of the logic for making a decision and executing trades remains the same) ...
    action = self.agent.select_action(state_vector)
    action_map = {0: "HOLD", 1: "BUY", 2: "SELL"}
    self.log_message.emit(f"ü§ñ Model Decision: {action_map[action]}", "decision")
    
    if action == 1 and position_for_epic is None:
        self.log_message.emit(f"Executing BUY order for {TRADING_EPIC}...", "trade")
        result = self.api.create_position(epic=TRADING_EPIC, direction="BUY", size=TRADE_SIZE)
        if result and result.get('dealReference'):
            self.log_message.emit(f"‚úÖ Position creation request successful. Ref: {result['dealReference']}", "trade")
        else:
            self.log_message.emit(f"‚ùå Position creation FAILED. API response: {result}", "error")

    elif action == 2 and position_for_epic is not None:
        deal_id = position_for_epic.get('position', {}).get('dealId')
        self.log_message.emit(f"Executing CLOSE order for position {deal_id}...", "trade")
        result = self.api.close_position(deal_id)
        if result:
            self.log_message.emit(f"‚úÖ Position close request successful.", "trade")
        else:
            self.log_message.emit(f"‚ùå Position close FAILED for {deal_id}. API response: {result}", "error")
Step 3: Update construct_state to Use All New Data
This is where we add the new indicators (ATR, Stochastic Oscillator) and merge all the data into the final state vector that the model will see.

Python

# In the TradingWorker class

def construct_state(self, df_gold, df_dxy, df_vix, current_position, sentiment_score):
    """
    Constructs the enhanced state vector from all data sources.
    """
    # Align all dataframes to the gold index to handle any missing timestamps
    if df_dxy is not None:
        df_gold['dxy_close'] = df_dxy['Close']
        df_gold['dxy_close'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
    else:
        df_gold['dxy_close'] = 0 # Use a neutral value if data is missing

    if df_vix is not None:
        df_gold['vix_close'] = df_vix['Close']
        df_gold['vix_close'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
    else:
        df_gold['vix_close'] = 0 # Use a neutral value if data is missing

    if len(df_gold) < LOOKBACK_WINDOW:
        return None

    # Take the last n steps for the lookback window
    df_window = df_gold.iloc[-LOOKBACK_WINDOW:]
    
    # --- Feature Engineering ---
    # 1. Price change (log returns)
    price_change = np.log(df_window['Close'] / df_window['Close'].shift(1)).fillna(0)
    
    # 2. Existing Technical Indicators
    rsi = df_window.ta.rsi().fillna(50)
    macd = df_window.ta.macd(fast=12, slow=26, signal=9)
    macd_line = macd['MACD_12_26_9'].fillna(0)
    macd_signal = macd['MACDs_12_26_9'].fillna(0)
    bbands = df_window.ta.bbands(length=20)
    bb_upper = bbands['BBU_20_2.0'].fillna(0)
    bb_lower = bbands['BBL_20_2.0'].fillna(0)
    bb_percent = (df_window['Close'] - bb_lower) / (bb_upper - bb_lower + 1e-9)
    bb_percent.fillna(0.5, inplace=True)

    # --- NEW Technical Indicators ---
    # 3. Average True Range (ATR) for volatility
    atr = df_window.ta.atr(length=14).fillna(0)
    # 4. Stochastic Oscillator for overbought/oversold levels
    stoch = df_window.ta.stoch(k=14, d=3, smooth_k=3)
    stoch_k = stoch['STOCHk_14_3_3'].fillna(50)
    stoch_d = stoch['STOCHd_14_3_3'].fillna(50)
    # --- End of New Indicators ---

    # 5. Correlated Assets (normalized percentage change)
    dxy_change = df_window['dxy_close'].pct_change().fillna(0)
    vix_change = df_window['vix_close'].pct_change().fillna(0)

    # --- Position Information ---
    has_position = 1.0 if current_position else 0.0
    pnl = 0.0
    if has_position:
        pnl = current_position.get('position', {}).get('pnl', 0.0)
    normalized_pnl = pnl / 1000 
    
    # --- Assemble State Vector ---
    # IMPORTANT: The order here MUST MATCH the order in your new training script
    state_parts = [
        # Existing features
        price_change.values,
        rsi.values,
        macd_line.values,
        macd_signal.values,
        bb_percent.values,
        # New features
        atr.values,
        stoch_k.values,
        stoch_d.values,
        dxy_change.values,
        vix_change.values,
        # Contextual features
        [sentiment_score] * LOOKBACK_WINDOW,
        [has_position] * LOOKBACK_WINDOW,
        [normalized_pnl] * LOOKBACK_WINDOW
    ]

    # Transpose to get shape (LOOKBACK_WINDOW, num_features)
    state = np.array(state_parts).T.flatten()

    # Use the fitted scaler to transform the state
    return self.scaler.transform([state])[0]
Your Next, Critical Steps
Update data_pipeline.py: You must modify your data pipeline to fetch and save the historical data for DXY and VIX alongside the gold and sentiment data.

Update rl_gold_traderv0_01.py: Modify your training script to include all the new features (ATR, Stochastic, DXY change, VIX change) in the state representation. The order of features must be identical to the state_parts list above.

Retrain Your Model: This is not optional. You must run the updated training script on the new, richer dataset to create a new rl_gold_trader.pth model file. This new model will be the only one that understands how to interpret this enhanced state.

Load the New Model: Finally, update the filename in live_rl_trading.py to load your newly trained model.

By completing these steps, you will provide your model with a much more comprehensive view of the market, which is a key step toward developing a more robust and potentially more profitable trading strategy.
