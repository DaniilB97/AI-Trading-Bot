Your Next, Critical Updates
Update data_pipeline.py: You must modify your data pipeline to fetch and save the historical data for DXY and VIX alongside the gold and sentiment data.

Update rl_gold_traderv0_01.py: Modify your training script to include all the new features (ATR, Stochastic, DXY change, VIX change) in the state representation. The order of features must be identical to the state_parts list above.

Retrain Your Model: This is not optional. You must run the updated training script on the new, richer dataset to create a new rl_gold_trader.pth model file. This new model will be the only one that understands how to interpret this enhanced state.

Load the New Model: Finally, update the filename in live_rl_trading.py to load your newly trained model.

By completing these steps, you will provide your model with a much more comprehensive view of the market, which is a key step toward developing a more robust and potentially more profitable trading strategy.

also we should make changes for other stuff

for example

if we trade commoditties and forex we should add the function to not open any positions on saturday and sunday

and also add time for all market opens time

like the time in new yourk

and time before oppening the markets

like in Toronto

new youok

london

### My Understanding of Your Current System

Based on my review of the four files, here is my understanding of your project:

1.  **`capital_request.py`**: This is the foundational layer of your system. It's a dedicated API client for interacting with the Capital.com **demo** service. Its sole purpose is to handle authentication (logging in to get tokens) and to make authenticated requests to various API endpoints for fetching data (account details, prices, positions) and executing actions (creating/closing positions).

2.  **`data_pipeline.py`**: This script acts as your ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. It uses `capital_request.py` to fetch historical hourly price data for **GOLD**. It also uses a separate news API (`MarketAux`) to fetch news articles and their pre-calculated sentiment scores. It then merges the price data and sentiment data into a single Pandas DataFrame, aligning them by the hour, and saves the final, combined dataset to a CSV file named `gold_data_with_sentiment_hourly.csv`.

3.  **`rl_gold_traderv0_01.py`**: This is your Machine Learning training script. It loads the CSV file created by `data_pipeline.py`. It defines a custom Reinforcement Learning environment (`NewsTradingEnvironment`) where the "state" is composed of technical indicators and the sentiment score from the data. It then uses a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm to train an `ActorCritic` neural network model. The goal of this model is to learn a profitable trading strategy. Finally, it saves the trained model's weights to a `.pth` file.

4.  **`live_rl_trading.py`**: This is the live execution engine and dashboard. It loads the trained RL model (`.pth` file). It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with PyQt6 to display logs, account balance, and open positions. In the background, a `TradingWorker` thread fetches live market data for **GOLD**, gets a sentiment score from a placeholder news function, constructs a state vector just like in training, and feeds it to the loaded model. The model then outputs an action (BUY, SELL, HOLD), which the bot executes via the `capital_request.py` API client.

In short, you have a complete, end-to-end system: one script to prepare data, one to train a model on that data, and one to deploy that model for live (demo) trading, all supported by a central API communication module.

### Planning the Next Critical Updates

Now, let's plan the changes you requested. I will break them down into steps and ask for clarification where needed. **I will not make any changes until you confirm the plan.**

#### **Step 1: Enhance `data_pipeline.py` to Fetch DXY and VIX Data**

**Goal:** Modify the data pipeline to fetch and include historical data for the US Dollar Index (DXY) and the Volatility Index (VIX) alongside the existing Gold and sentiment data.

**My Proposed Plan:**

1.  In `data_pipeline.py`, I will update the price fetching loop. In addition to fetching data for "GOLD", I will add two more calls inside the loop to `price_checker.get_historical_prices` to get data for DXY and VIX.
2.  I will then process the raw data for DXY and VIX into separate DataFrames, similar to how `create_ohlc_df` works for Gold.
3.  Finally, I will merge these new DXY and VIX DataFrames with the main Gold and sentiment DataFrame. I will align them on the hourly 'Datetime' index. The columns from DXY and VIX will be renamed to be specific (e.g., `DXY_Close`, `VIX_Close`).

**My Questions for You:**

* **Crucial:** What are the exact "epics" (instrument codes) for the US Dollar Index and the Volatility Index on the Capital.com demo API? I need these to fetch the correct data. Common examples are `DXY` or `USDOLLAR` for the dollar index, and `VIX` or `VOLX` for the volatility index. Can you please confirm them?
* Do you only want the 'Close' price for DXY and VIX, or the full OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close)? For calculating percentage change, the 'Close' price is usually sufficient.

---

#### **Step 2: Update `rl_gold_traderv0_01.py` with New Features**

**Goal:** Modify the RL training script to include new features (ATR, DXY change, VIX change) in the state representation for the model.

**My Proposed Plan:**

1.  In the `NewsTradingEnvironment` class, after fetching the new `gold_data_with_sentiment_dxy_vix.csv` file, I will add new feature calculation steps inside the `_add_technical_indicators` method.
2.  I will calculate the Average True Range (ATR) on Gold's OHLC data using `df.ta.atr()`.
3.  I will calculate the percentage change for the DXY and VIX close prices.
4.  I will then update the `self.feature_columns` list to include these new features in the precise order you require for the state representation.
5.  You mentioned "Stochastic" again. The model already uses `STOCHk_14_3_3`. I will assume for now this was a repeat and will add the other new features.



**My Questions for You:**

* What calculation period (length) should be used for the new ATR indicator? A common default is 14.
* You listed "Stochastic" as a new feature. Since `STOCHk_14_3_3` is already in use, was this an accidental repeat, or did you want to add a Stochastic indicator with different parameters? - accidental repeat
* After these changes, the model **must be retrained**. The old model will not work because the input (the state) it expects will be a different size and structure. Do you agree that the next step after this modification is for you to run the training script to generate a new `.pth` file? - sure, we have to make the model more unique and smart

---

#### **Step 3: Add Trading Time Restrictions to `live_rl_trading.py`**

**Goal:** Prevent the bot from opening new positions on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).

**My Proposed Plan:**

1.  In `live_rl_trading.py`, inside the `run_trading_cycle` method of the `TradingWorker` class, I will get the current day of the week before the agent decides on an action.
2.  I will add a condition that checks if the current day is Saturday (weekday 5) or Sunday (weekday 6).
3.  If it is a weekend, I will log a message like "Weekend detected, skipping new trade execution" and will prevent any BUY or SELL signals from being processed. The bot will effectively be in a "HOLD" state for the weekend.

**My Question for You:**

* The plan is to block *opening new positions* on weekends. Should the bot also be prevented from *closing an existing position* (i.e., executing a SELL action if it's already in a BUY position)? Or should closing be allowed?

---

#### **Step 4: Display Market Open Times in `live_rl_trading.py`**

**Goal:** Add a visual indicator to the GUI showing the current status (Open/Closed) of the London, New York, and Toronto stock markets.

**My Proposed Plan:**

1.  In `live_rl_trading.py`, I will add a new visual element to the `MainDashboard` UI, likely a horizontal layout with three labels: "London:", "New York:", "Toronto:".
2.  I will create a helper function that determines if these markets are open based on the current UTC time. I will use standard trading hours for this (e.g., London: 08:00-16:30 UTC, New York/Toronto: 14:30-21:00 UTC).
3.  The `UIUpdateWorker`, which already runs periodically, will call this function and update the labels with an "Open" or "Closed" status and change their color (e.g., green for open, red for closed).

**My Question for You:**

* Are the standard trading hours mentioned above sufficient for this visual indicator, or do you have specific pre-market/after-hours times you want to be considered?

Please review my understanding and the proposed plan. Once you answer my questions and give the go-ahead, I will proceed with generating the necessary code modifications for each file, one step at a time.


------
Of course. I understand you want to see just the specific lines of code that need to be changed or added for the updates we've discussed.

Here are the necessary code modifications for each file.

-----

### **1. Changes for `data_pipeline.py`**   ✅✅✅✅

**Goal:** Fetch GOLD, DXY, and VIX data and merge them.

**In `data_pipeline.py`, make these changes:**

```python
# Near the top of the main() function, define the instruments to fetch
INSTRUMENTS = ["GOLD", "DXY", "VIX"]

# Replace the old create_ohlc_df function with this more generic one
def create_instrument_df(price_data: dict, epic: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # ... (function content as provided in the full script)
    # The key change is that it now creates a column named f'{epic}_Close'
    # and only processes the close price.

# Inside the main loop, iterate over the new list
for epic in INSTRUMENTS:
    # ... existing logic to fetch data for the given epic

# After the loop, replace the old price_df creation with this logic to combine all data
price_df = pd.concat(combined_price_dfs, axis=1)
price_df.sort_index(inplace=True)
price_df.ffill(inplace=True) # Forward-fill to handle non-trading hours

# At the end of the script, change the output filename
output_filename = "gold_data_with_sentiment_dxy_vix.csv"
```

-----

### **2. Changes for `rl_gold_traderv0_01.py`**

**Goal:** Add ATR, DXY change, and VIX change to the model's state.

**In `rl_gold_traderv0_01.py`, make these changes:**

```python
# In the NewsTradingEnvironment class, update the list of feature columns.
# The order must be consistent for training and live trading.
self.feature_columns = [
    'RSI_14', 'STOCHk_14_3_3', 'CCI_14_0.015', 'Price_Change_5', 'sentiment',
    'ATR_14', 'DXY_change', 'VIX_change'
]

# In the _add_technical_indicators method, add the new feature calculations.
# This requires the new CSV with DXY_Close and VIX_Close columns.
# You will also need to load GOLD's OHLC data to calculate ATR.
def _add_technical_indicators(self):
    """Расчет и добавление технических индикаторов."""
    # Existing indicators
    self.data.ta.rsi(length=14, append=True)
    self.data.ta.stoch(k=14, d=3, smooth_k=3, append=True)
    self.data.ta.cci(length=14, append=True)
    self.data['Price_Change_5'] = self.data['GOLD_Close'].pct_change(periods=5) # Assuming GOLD_Close is the main price

    # --- ADD THESE LINES ---
    # Note: ATR needs High, Low, Close columns which are not in the new CSV.
    # You would need to modify the data pipeline to include them for GOLD.
    # Assuming you have them, the line would be:
    # self.data.ta.atr(length=14, append=True) # Let's name it 'ATR_14'
    self.data['DXY_change'] = self.data['DXY_Close'].pct_change()
    self.data['VIX_change'] = self.data['VIX_Close'].pct_change()
    # --- END OF ADDED LINES ---

    self.data.bfill(inplace=True)
    self.data.dropna(inplace=True)
```

***Important Note:*** As highlighted in the code comments, calculating the ATR requires Open, High, and Low prices for Gold, which we previously decided to omit from the new CSV to keep it simple. To add ATR, you would first need to update `data_pipeline.py` to also save the `GOLD_Open`, `GOLD_High`, and `GOLD_Low` columns.

-----

### **3. Changes for `live_rl_trading.py`**

**Goal:** Add weekend trading restrictions and display market hours.

**In `live_rl_trading.py`, make these changes:**

**A) Weekend Trading Rule:**

```python
# In the TradingWorker class, inside the run_trading_cycle method:

# --- ADD THIS CHECK BEFORE EXECUTING A TRADE ---
from datetime import datetime

action = self.agent.select_action(state_vector)
action_map = {0: "HOLD", 1: "BUY", 2: "SELL"}
self.log_message.emit(f"🤖 Решение модели: {action_map[action]}", "decision")

# Check if today is Saturday (5) or Sunday (6)
is_weekend = datetime.now().weekday() in [5, 6]
if is_weekend and action in [1, 2]: # Block opening/closing on weekends
    self.log_message.emit("Weekend detected. No new trades will be executed.", "info")
    return # Exit the cycle early
# --- END OF ADDED CHECK ---

# Existing logic for executing buy/sell orders...
if action == 1 and position_for_epic is None:
    # ...
```

**B) Display Market Hours:**

```python
# Add a helper function somewhere in the script, outside any class
def get_market_status():
    from datetime import datetime, timezone
    now_utc = datetime.now(timezone.utc).time()
    status = {}
    # London (approx 8am-4:30pm UTC)
    status['London'] = "OPEN" if now_utc.hour >= 8 and now_utc.hour <= 16 else "CLOSED"
    # New York (approx 2:30pm-9pm UTC)
    status['New York'] = "OPEN" if (now_utc.hour == 14 and now_utc.minute >= 30) or (now_utc.hour > 14 and now_utc.hour < 21) else "CLOSED"
    # Toronto is same as New York
    status['Toronto'] = status['New York']
    return status

# In the MainDashboard class, inside init_ui:
# --- ADD THESE LINES TO CREATE THE LABELS ---
self.market_status_layout = QHBoxLayout()
self.london_status_label = QLabel("London: ...")
self.ny_status_label = QLabel("New York: ...")
self.toronto_status_label = QLabel("Toronto: ...")
self.market_status_layout.addWidget(self.london_status_label)
self.market_status_layout.addWidget(self.ny_status_label)
self.market_status_layout.addWidget(self.toronto_status_label)
# Add this new layout to your main grid layout, e.g., below the P&L card
self.layout.addLayout(self.market_status_layout, 0, 2) # Example position
# --- END OF ADDED LINES ---


# In the UIUpdateWorker class, inside the run method:
# --- ADD THESE LINES TO UPDATE THE LABELS ---
market_status = get_market_status()
# This assumes you have access to the main window's labels.
# A more robust way is to emit this data via a signal.
# For simplicity, let's assume direct update is possible or handled by a signal.
# In the on_data_received method of MainDashboard:
self.london_status_label.setText(f"London: {market_status['London']}")
self.ny_status_label.setText(f"New York: {market_status['New York']}")
self.toronto_status_label.setText(f"Toronto: {market_status['Toronto']}")
# You would also add color coding here based on status.
# --- END OF ADDED LINES ---
```
