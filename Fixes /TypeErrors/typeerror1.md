Of course. It looks like you've run into a new set of issues, which is very common when building complex systems. You've actually found two separate problems, one in each of your main scripts.

Let's solve the main one first, which is the error in your rl_gold_trader.py script.

The error KeyError: 'RSI' means the code is looking for a column named "RSI", but the pandas-ta library actually creates a column with a more specific name, like "RSI_14".

The most robust way to fix this is to update the script to use the correct, full column names that the library generates. I have updated the NewsTradingEnvironment class in the Canvas to use these correct names. This should resolve the error.

The Second Error (in data_pipeline.py)
The other error you saw (ValueError: Could not find BertForSequenceClassification...) is an internal issue with the transformers library in your Colab environment, often caused by a library version conflict after restarting the runtime. The easiest way to fix this is to force a clean re-installation. Before running your data_pipeline.py script again, run this command in a Colab cell:
!pip install --force-reinstall torch torchvision transformers

Now, let's apply the fix to your main trading script.
