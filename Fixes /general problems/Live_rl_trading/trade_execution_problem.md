Of course. Based on the code you provided and the screenshot, I can explain the problem and guide you on how to fix and verify it.

The Core Problem: The Trade is Never Actually Sent
The issue is straightforward: in your live_rl_trading.py script, the lines that actually execute the trade by calling the API are commented out.

The script logs the intent to trade, which is why you see "Executing BUY order for GOLD..." in your log, but it never sends the create_position request to the Capital.com server.

Here is the exact code block from your TradingWorker class in live_rl_trading.py:

Python

# ... inside the run_trading_cycle method ...

if action == 1 and position_for_epic is None:
    self.log_message.emit(f"Executing BUY order for {TRADING_EPIC}...", "trade")
    # self.api.create_position(epic=TRADING_EPIC, direction="BUY", size=TRADE_SIZE)  # <-- THIS LINE IS COMMENTED OUT
elif action == 2 and position_for_epic is not None:
    deal_id = position_for_epic.get('position', {}).get('dealId')
    self.log_message.emit(f"Executing CLOSE order for position {deal_id}...", "trade")
    # self.api.close_position(deal_id) # <-- THIS LINE IS ALSO COMMENTED OUT
Because self.api.create_position(...) is never called, no position is ever opened, and the UI correctly reports "No open positions."
